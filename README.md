# Election-Data-Analysis---Polls-and-Donors

In this Data Project I have analyzed two datasets from the 2012 election.

## The first data set is the results of political polls. I have analyzed the aggregated poll data and answer some questions:
  1. Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
  2. Did the poll results favor Romney or Obama?
  3. How do undecided voters effect the poll?
  4. Can we account for the undecided voters?
  5. How did voter sentiment change over time?
  6. Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

## The second data set is the information on donations to the federal campaign. The following are the questions I tried to answer while looking at this Data Set:
  1. How much was donated and what was the average donation?
  2. How did the donations differ between candidates?
  3. How did the donations differ between Democrats and Republicans?
  4. What were the demographics of the donors?
  5. Is there a pattern to donation amounts?
